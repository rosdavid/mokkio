-- Fix RLS policies for avatars bucket
-- Run this if the main script didn't work

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Avatar images are publicly accessible" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own avatar" ON storage.objects;

-- Create new policies
CREATE POLICY "Avatar images are publicly accessible" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatar" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE USING (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatar" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
